Note: These instructions assume that you are using Jira Software Cloud. Because features are rolled out in
stages to groups of users, the details that you see may be slightly different. If you use other Jira versions, the
details will also be different for you.
Note: These instructions DO NOT APPLY to next-gen projects. If you see messaging that you have created a
next-gen project, you are on the wrong path and should create a classic project.
1. If this is your first project:
You may be asked questions related to your agile experience and type of project that you are
interested in creating. These questions help decide the template of your first project. On the screens
that you are shown, select Skip question or Skip, depending on the what the button says.
On the Choose a classic template screen, select the Kanban template.
2. If this is not your first project (note- in Jira, you may see some slightly different steps than listed here):
Log in to Jira (if necessary). You can log in using https://[your_site_name].atlassian.net or find your
site name at https://my.atlassian.com.
Click the Projects tab.
Click the Create project dropdown.Select the Classic project option. DO NOT select the "next-gen" option. These instructions only
apply to classic projects.
3. In the Create project window, enter projectA for the project name.
4. Click the Change template button. At the top of the screen, you should see Choose a classic template. If
you see Choose a next-gen template, you are on the wrong path. Navigate back to the screen with the
Create project dropdown, click Create project and select the classic project option.
5. Select the Kanban classic template.
A template is the initial configuration of your project. Each template provides different default behavior
and tools to the project. We are selecting the kanban template. Among other things, this means that a
kanban board will be included with the project. We will discuss kanban boards later.
6. Click Create.
7. You should see the kanban board for your project.
Congratulations, you have created a classic kanban project.
3:Createissues.
The planned work of a project is broken down into issues. Issues are also known as work items, stories and
more. We will start with three simple issues, named "add item 1", "add item 2" and "add item 3".
1. Create an issue named "add item 1":
Click the Create button at the top (or the + sign in the sidebar) to create an issue.
Under Summary, enter add item 1 .
The Issue Type should be Story .
Since you are creating more issues after this one, you have the option to click the Create another
checkbox to expedite issue creation.
Click Create.
2. Create an issue named add item 2 .
3. Create an issue named add item 3 .
4. On your kanban board, you should see your three issues in the backlog column. We will discuss the backlog
later.
5. To view the project's issues in a list, click on the Issues and filters tab in the sidebar, then select All
issues.
6. Click on Back to project and then Kanban board to navigate back to the kanban board.
Congratulations, you have created three issues and completed this lab.
