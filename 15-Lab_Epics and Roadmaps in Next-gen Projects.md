Lab: Epics and Roadmaps in Next-gen Projects
Estimated time: 15 minutes
In this lab, you will:
1. Create an epic using a roadmap and by creating an issue.
2. View swimlanes by epic.
3. Add new and existing issues to an epic.
4. Complete an epic.
Note: These instructions assume that you have you created a next-gen kanban project named projectAng
in earlier labs.
These instructions DO NOT APPLY to classic projects.
1:Createanepicusingaroadmapandbycreatinganissue.
1. In your projectAng next-gen kanban project, create an epic using the Roadmap feature. Click Roadmap
in the sidebar. This brings up a planning timeline for your project. Inside the roadmap, click Create Epic.
Name the epic Feature 1 . You can change the start and due dates by moving and/or resizing an epic.
You can change the color of the epic by clicking the square color in the epic's details.
2. Create a second epic by creating an issue of type Epic and adding a Summary of Feature 2 . You may
have to refresh your browser window to see the epic in your roadmap. Because you didn't specify start and
due dates when creating the epic, the horizontal epic bar has cloudy endpoints. Drag the horizontal bar to
set the start and due dates.
Roadmaps are a great way to plan and visualize your larger pieces of work in the project, keeping your
planning closely tied to your individual work items. As your plan changes, you can easily update your
roadmap.
Congratulations, you have created epics using a roadmap and by creating an epic issue.
2:View swimlanesbyepic.
1. From the board, select Epic from the Group by dropdown on the right. There are no issues in your epics, so
this change isn't very interesting right now.
Congratulations, you have viewed swimlanes by epic.
3:Addnew andexistingissuestoanepic.
1. Add a new issue to each epic. You can do this by clicking on an epic in the roadmap and clicking on the Add
a child issue icon (it looks like a simple hierarchy) at the top of the epic details panel.
2. Add existing issues to each epic. Here are two ways to do this:
From your board with swimlanes by epic, drag an issue to an epic.
From the epic issue's details (e.g. by clicking on an epic in the roadmap), add a child issue under
Child issues..
Congratulations, you have added new and existing issues to an epic.4:Completeanepic.
1. Change the child issues of an epic to have a status of Done .
2. Change the epic issue's status to Done .
3. Click on Roadmap. The epic should be gray with a checkbox indicating the epic is done.
Congratulations, you have completed an epic and finished this lab.
