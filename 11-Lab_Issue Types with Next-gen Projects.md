Lab: Issue Types with Next-gen Projects
Estimated time: 15 minutes
In this lab, you will:
1. Create issues of different types.
2. Create subtasks.
3. Add a custom issue type to your project.
Note: These instructions assume that you created a next-gen kanban project named projectAng in an
earlier lab.
These instructions DO NOT APPLY to classic projects.
1:Createissuesofdifferent types.
1. Navigate to your projectAng next-gen kanban project board.
2. If your board has a separate backlog (a Backlog tab), turn off the Backlog feature under Project settings
> Features. This is so you can see the issues on the board when you create them.
3. Use the Create button (or the + icon in the sidebar) to create an issue with a summary/title named add
item 4 (or the next item number). Assign an Issue Type of Task to the issue. Notice that by default,
only Task and Epic issue types are available for next-gen kanban projects.
4. Assume that your team decides that you want to specify issues of type Bug . Notice that Bug is not an
option when creating a new issue (as done above). This is because next-gen projects try to keep the
interface as simple as possible, allowing teams to "turn on" capabilities only if they need them. Enable the
ability of the team to create issues of type Bug with the following steps:
Click Project settings.
Click Issue types.
In the sidebar, click + Add issue type.
Select Bug and click Add. (Notice that you could use this same approach to add issues of type
Story.)
Navigate out of project settings.
5. Create an issue with a summary/title named fix bug 1 . Assign an Issue Type of Bug to the issue.
6. Move the issues through some of the statuses on the board. Notice that they all behave in the same way,
because they all use the same workflow.
Congratulations, you have added issue types to your project and created issues of different types.
2:Createsubtasks.
1. From the board, open the add item 4 issue. Click on add a child issue to create a subtask for this task.
2. Create a subtask with a summary/title of add item 4a . Notice that a new issue key and status are
assigned to the subtask.
3. Create another subtask with a summary/title of add item 4b .
4. View the board. Notice that the simple hierarchy icon is added to the add item 4 task.5. Click on the add item 4 task. Click on a subtask and change the subtask's status. Notice that subtasks
have independent statuses.
6. View the board. In the Group by dropdown, select Subtask . You should see your subtasks in a
separate swimlane.
7. Change the status of the add item 4 issue and its subtasks to Done . You can open the parent issue to
change its status to Done .
Congratulations, you have created subtasks.
3:Addacustomissuetypetoyourproject.
Custom issue types allow your team to create issues that are appropriate for the types of work that the team
does.
1. With your projectAng next-gen project selected, click Project settings from the sidebar.
2. Click Issue types.
3. In the sidebar, click + Add issue type.
4. Click Create issue type.
5. Name the type Small . Add a description of A work item that is tracked but takes a small
amount of time to complete. Click Change icon and change the icon to a minus sign (-), or any icon
that you prefer. Click Create to add the type to your project.
6. Navigate back to your project. Create an issue of type Small named small item 1 . View the item on
the board. Notice your icon.
Congratulations, you have added a custom issue type to your project and completed this lab.
