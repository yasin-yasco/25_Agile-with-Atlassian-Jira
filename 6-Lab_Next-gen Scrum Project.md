Lab: Next-gen Scrum Project
Estimated time: 20 minutes
In this lab, you will:
1. Create a next-gen scrum project.
2. Create issues.
3. Create and plan a sprint.
4. Execute a sprint.
5. Complete a sprint.
1:Createanext-genscrumproject.
This lab creates a next-gen scrum project. These instructions DO NOT APPLY to classic scrum projects.
1. Log into Jira (if necessary). https://[your_site_name].atlassian.net
2. Click Projects. (You may need to click on the Jira icon in the upper left to see it.)
3. Click Create project.
4. Select the next-gen project option. DO NOT select the "classic" option. These instructions only apply to
next-gen projects.
5. For the project name, enter projectBng .
6. If you are using the free plan, you should notice that anyone with access to your site (meaning that they
were added as a user of the site) can access and and administer this project. If you are not using the free
plan, there should be an Access dropdown. You should set the access to Open.
7. Click Change template. Verify that that message at the top the screen says that you are creating a nextgen template.
8. Select the Scrum template.
9. Click Create. You should see your projectBng project.
10. Click Project settings. Click Features. Notice that the Backlog and Sprints features are automatically
turned on for next-gen scrum projects. Navigate back to the project.
Congratulations, you have created a scrum project.
2:Createissues.
1. The issues of your project are initially placed in the product backlog. Click the Backlog tab to view it. It
should be empty.
2. Create three issues of type Story in the product backlog with summaries of add item 1 , add item 2
and add item 3 . You can do this by clicking on Create (or the + sign) or by typing directly in the
Backlog.
Congratulations, you have created a product backlog with three issues.
3:Createandplanasprint.A sprint is a period of time where you complete a certain number of issues.
1. Click on the Backlog tab.
2. If you do not see sprint 1, click Create sprint. You should see an empty Sprint 1 along with the product
backlog.
The start of the sprint includes a sprint planning meeting. In this meeting, the sprint team usually
decides on the sprint goal, estimates the amount of work of issues and decides which issues to
complete during the sprint. The development team decides how to accomplish the work of the sprint.
All projects and sprint planning meetings are unique.
3. Add estimates as story points to the issues. We will arbitrarily say that add item 1 is 1 point, add item
2 is 2 points and add item 3 is 4 points.
Click on each issue in the product backlog and add its estimate under the Story point
estimate field.
The development team usually is responsible for estimating story points. Story points are relative units
indicating the effort involved in completing the issue.
4. Prioritize the product backlog. We will arbitrarily give the 2 point story ( add item 2 ) the highest priority
and the 4 point story the lowest priority.
Drag and drop the stories into their correct order in the backlog. (With add item 2 at the top.)
The product owner is usually responsible for prioritizing stories in the product backlog.
5. Add stories to the sprint. We will arbitrarily assume that the team can execute up to four story points per
sprint. This is known as the team's velocity.
Drag the add item 2 and add item 1 stories to the sprint. The set of stories in the sprint are
called the sprint backlog.
6. Notice that the team has estimated that its velocity for this sprint will be 3 story points.
The development team is usually responsible for deciding how many of the top issues to move to the
sprint backlog.
Congratulations, you have created and planned a sprint.
4:Executeasprint.
1. Click the Start sprint button associated with the sprint backlog. Change the duration of the sprint to 1
week . Add a sprint goal of Create the first product increment. Click Start.
The scrum team agrees to the sprint goal during the sprint planning meeting.
2. The Board tab should be selected, and you should see the board for your current sprint. Notice that you
have two issues in the TO DO column. Notice that the other columns are IN PROGRESS and DONE .
Notice the sprint goal under the sprint name. Notice the the story point estimate is shown on the cards.
3. Open any issue on the board and click on the status dropdown in the upper right. Notice that there are
three statuses in the workflow, TO DO , IN PROGRESS and DONE . These are the default statuses in the
workflow when you choose the next-gen scrum template while creating a project. Notice that there is no
BACKLOG status.The default workflow for projects created with the next-gen kanban template contain these same three
statuses.
4. Select the Backlog tab. View the status of the add item 3 issue that is still in your product backlog.
Notice that its status is To Do , the same status as the issues in the first column of the sprint board. The
items in the product backlog are there because they have not been added to any sprints. As with classic
scrum projects, the status of each issue is independent of the product backlog.
5. Notice that there is no Reports tab in the sidebar. Enable the Reports feature in your project under Project
settings > Features.
6. Back in your project, click the Reports tab. View the Sprint burndown chart report for this sprint. Jira has
added guidelines for story point completion during the sprint. The starting value is the total number of story
points that you added to the sprint backlog. The ending value is zero. For the duration of the sprint, a linear
decrease in the number remaining story points is assumed. Under the chart, you should see the issues of
the sprint.
Reports like this are a great way to quickly view the current status of the sprint.
7. Navigate back to your board. Let's assume that you are a member of the development team and that you
will work on the add item 2 issue. Open the issue and under the Assignee field, click Assign to me.
8. Navigate back to the sprint board. Notice your icon in the add item 2 card. Drag the add item 2
issue to the IN PROGRESS column.
9. Let's assume that you have finished the add item 2 issue. Drag it to the DONE column.
10. Repeat the process above and complete the add item 1 issue.
Congratulations, you have executed a sprint.
5:Completeasprint.
1. Now that the issues of the sprint are complete, you can end the sprint. In the upper right above the board,
click Complete sprint and then Complete sprint.
You usually only complete a sprint at the end of the planned sprint duration. We are ending it early just
for learning purposes.
2. Click Reports. View the Velocity report. You estimated and completed three story points in this sprint, so
your velocity for sprint 1 was three story points.
3. At this point, you would usually have a sprint review meeting to show the new increment to the scrum team
and optionally to its stakeholders.
4. After the sprint review meeting is a meeting called the sprint retrospective. This is a meeting for the scrum
team to discuss how the team can execute better next time.
Congratulations, you have completed a sprint and completed this lab.
